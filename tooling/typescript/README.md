# TypeScript Configurations

## Base Configuration (`base.ts`)

This configuration file contains the core TypeScript settings shared across the project. It ensures compatibility, performance, and strict type-checking.

## Internal Package Configuration (`internal-package.json`)

This file extends the base configuration and is tailored for internal packages. It focuses on emitting declaration files to enhance editor performance.

## Suggestions

- Add path aliases for better module resolution.
- Use the `composite` option for larger projects to improve build performance.
- Integrate ESLint with TypeScript for better linting.
- Configure testing frameworks appropriately.
- Maintain clear documentation for better understanding.
- Ensure build tools are configured to work with TypeScript.
